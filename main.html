  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>
    I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve problems and improve people's lives. As a developer, I have the opportunity to not only learn and work with cutting-edge technologies, but also to use my skills and creativity to build applications and systems that can have a real impact on the world.

I am also drawn to the constantly evolving nature of the field. There is always something new to learn and discover, and the fast-paced nature of the industry means that there are always new challenges to tackle.

Ultimately, I want to become a developer because it combines my passion for technology with the opportunity to create and make a difference.
